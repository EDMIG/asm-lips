A major part of having correct pronunciation when learning a new language is moving your lips in the correct way.
One solution to this is software which will track a student's lip movements and provide feedback.
This paper describes how a C++ library will be created to accurately track lips in provided images.
This library will attempt to use a CUDA-enabled GPU and will fall back to a CPU implementation if such a GPU is not found.
As a result, the lip tracking library will run on Windows, Linux, and OS X, as well as Android devices. 

The lip tracking algorithm is a hybrid between several approaches. 
It will perform edge detection and color segmentation as a preprocessing step before using an Active Shape Model to find the final lip contour.
This approach is highly efficient and parallelizable for a GPU.
