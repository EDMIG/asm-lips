A major part of having correct pronunciation when learning a new language is moving your lips in the correct way.
This is a difficult thing to learn and to teach.
One solution to this is software which tracks a student's lip movements and provides feedback.
This paper describes how we have created a C++ library to accurately track lips in provided images.
Further, this library attempts to use a CUDA-enabled GPU implementation to improve the algorithm's performance. It will fall back on a CPU implementation if such a GPU is not found. As a result, the lip tracking library runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X, as well as Android devices.
