\chapter{Development Timeline}

The figures below show timelines of the work we have done as well as when we will be working on and finishing each major task of this project that we have yet to complete, including the writing of the library, finishing the documentation, and preparation for the final presentations in the spring. By following this plan, we have and will continue to keep ourselves on schedule for our upcoming deadline.
