\chapter{Conceptual Model}

The interface to our lip-tracking library consists of six functions. Three are be used to obtain a lip contour model as an array of points, which is passed into the function. They also return a status code indicating success or failure. The array that is passed in must have already been allocated by the user, and the \texttt{getNumberOfContourPoints} function returns the size that the array should be. The other two functions allow the user to get and set a threshold value used in the first three functions. This threshold value determines the required confidence in the lip-tracking algorithm. The lower the threshold value, the less accurate the algorithm is. If the value is too high, however, the algorithm may fail to obtain a lip contour at the desired confidence level, in which case the functions return error codes.
