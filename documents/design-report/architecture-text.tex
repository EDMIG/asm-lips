\chapter{Architectual Diagram}

We will be using a data-flow architecture for our system, also known as a pipe-and-filter architecture. 
The system will have an array of pixel values for an image which gets modified by each filter it passes through.
The entire data flow for our system can be seen in \Cref{fig:architecture}.
