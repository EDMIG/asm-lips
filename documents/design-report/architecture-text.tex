\chapter{Architectural Diagram}

We used a data-flow architecture for our system, also known as a pipe-and-filter architecture. 
The system has an array of pixel values for an image which gets modified by each filter it passes through.Our original plan for the data flow for our system can be seen in \Cref{fig:architecture}. The current data flow of our system more closely resembles \Cref{fig:architecture-new}.
