\chapter{Test Plan}

It is necessary for us to test our system in order to ensure that our lip-tracking library is fully functional and meets all of the requirements we have identified for it. There are a number of different ways that we plan to test our system, the main points of which are listed below.

\section{Alpha Testing}

We have a library of videos and images of people's lips. We will visually analyze the output of our program for these inputs to see how accurately it tracks the lips.

We will also perform automated unit testing, including the following sets of test.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Checking a variety of images that either do or do not have lips in them to see whether the library properly identifies the lips or lack thereof in the image.
	\item Iterating through a range of acceptance threshold values on various images of lips to see when detection starts and stops.
\end{itemize}

\section{Beta Testing}

We will get a group of people with a diverse set of facial features to test our library with a webcam and visually analyze the results.
The variables we will try to test include mustaches, beards, teeth presence, lip color, and skin color.
