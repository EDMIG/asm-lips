\chapter{Test Plan}

It was necessary for us to test our system in order to ensure that our lip-tracking library was fully functional and met all of the requirements we identified for it. There were a number of different ways that we tested our system, the main points of which are listed below.

\section{Alpha Testing}

We have a library of videos and images of people's lips. We visually analyzed the output of our program for these inputs to see how accurately it tracked the lips. We also did runtime testing to evaluate the speed of different parts of the code in order to improve overall efficiency.

\section{Beta Testing}

We got several peer volunteers with a diverse set of facial features to test our library with a webcam and visually analyzed the results. The variables we aimed to test include mustaches, beards, teeth presence, lip color, and skin color. Beyond our peer volunteers, we got a number of volunteer testers when we attended and demoed our product at this years GPU Technology Conference.
