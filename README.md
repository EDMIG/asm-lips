GPU-Accelerated Lip-Tracking Library
============
Info:
This is a general purpose lip-tracking library. 
It uses the Active Shape Model algorithm, specifically the one detailed in [Mastering OpenCV](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-OpenCV-Practical-Computer-Projects/dp/1849517827). 
This code is largely the same code as from Mastering OpenCV, but with some optimizations using CUDA.


Prerequisites:
CMake and OpenCV 2.4.9 or 2.4.10 is installed
